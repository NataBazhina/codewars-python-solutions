Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

Example:
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000
Input constraints:

0 <= h <= 23
0 <= m <= 59
0 <= s <= 59

"""

def past(h, m, s):
    h1 = h * 3_600_000
    m1 = m * 60_000
    s1 = s * 1_000
    result = h1 + m1 + s1
    return result
